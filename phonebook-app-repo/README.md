## about this folder

This folder simulates Developers private code repository of Company. 
In user-data script, the developers' python and html code was cloned 
from the private repository `python-phonebook-app` to the web server where the code will be deployed.
So I imported all the files in that repository into this folder, 
because Github fee version only allows 1 private repo, so I had to delete it.
